###Feature Selection

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'.XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

###Performed data cleaning:

Data from test/X_test.txt and train/X_train.txt with joined 'Activity' and 'SubjectId' columns was merged into single .csv file.

Inertial Signals data from original data set was ignored and is not present in this one.

####Steps by step description:
1. Training and the test sets were merged into one data set.
2. Activity labels, that in original data set were provided in activity_labels.txt file, were included directly in data set in 'Activity' column.
3. Subject Ids, were included directly in data set in 'SubjectId' column.
4. Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were included in new data set.
5. Variable names, that in original data set were provided in features.txt file, were used as column names (after removing all '()' symbols and replacing '-' with '.').
6. Tidy data set was created, where each row contains average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

processed_data.csv - filename of new data set created by run_analysis.R script.
summarized_data.csv - filename of tidy data set created by run_analysis.R script.

####The set of variables estimated from these signals present in this dataset: 

* mean - Mean value
* std - Standard deviation


###Notes: 

* Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
